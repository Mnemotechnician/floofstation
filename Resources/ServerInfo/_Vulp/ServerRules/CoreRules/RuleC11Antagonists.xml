  [color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 11: Antagonists[/head][/color]

  [color=#a4885c]11.1[/color] Antagonistic roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay.

  [color=#a4885c]11.2[/color] Damage by any antagonist role must be proportional to their related objectives, and be pertinent to their objectives. Rarely if ever, station-wide destruction and mass killing is justifiable. Ask an Admin via AHelp if you are unsure.

  [color=#a4885c]11.3[/color] Playing a normally hostile ghost role as a friendly is permitted. However, it is strongly advised to seek permission from an admin if you wish to do so. Additionally, crew is not liable to treat "friendly" antagonistic roles as friendly.

  [color=#a4885c]11.5[/color] Avoid intentionally round removing people, unless your objectives require you to do so.

  [color=#a4885c]11.6[/color] The role of an antagonist is to make the game more fun, exciting and interesting, not miserable, unfun and frustrating. As such, try to play out the role accordingly, focusing not on winning, but on making things more thrilling and entertaining.

  [color=#a4885c]11.7[/color] Antagonists should refrain from collaborating unless they belong to the same faction and do have an actual mutual deal established. For example, a nuclear operative and an agent may collaborate, so long within terms such as, an operative helping an agent to complete one or more objectives, and in turn them helping with acquiring the nuke and the disk (but NOT staying behind to ensure it goes off).
