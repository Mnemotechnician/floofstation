  # Mining

  You know the drill. Get it? No? Okay, moving on.

  Mining is the process of extracting raw resources from the planet's surface.
  It is a job that requires a lot of effort and time.

  ## Mining tools

  You can craft a pickaxe in the autolathe, but it's a pretty crude and hard to use tool.
  Most rocks won't survive two hits from it, but some more stiff rocks and ores might take more.

  The ore processor can then be used to process raw ores into refined materials, such as steel, glass, gold, and more.

  If your colony has a working epistemics/science department, they will be able to unlock the salvage technology,
  which will provide you access to improved tools and machines for mining. Most of them are craftable in the protolathe,
  which the epistemics/science department can give you access to.
