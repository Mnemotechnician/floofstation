  # Farming

  You can use the shovel to dig up planet tiles. For example, digging up grass leaves a dirt tile beneath and yield you a grass tile.
  You can then shovel the dirt to get dirt items, which can be used to craft soil pots.

  The collected grass can then be used as compost in the soil pots.

  Shovels, just like other hydroponic tools, can be crafted in the autolathe.

  You can use any liquid container such as a bucket to collect water from rivers.
  Rivers can also be used to dispose of any unwanted chemicals.
