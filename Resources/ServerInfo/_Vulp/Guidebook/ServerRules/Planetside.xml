  # Planetside

  Vulpstation is a fork focused on planet-side survival.

  View the nested pages for more details and tips on how to survive and thrive on the planetside.

  ## Lore

  Your team has landed on a barren yet habitable planet, the designation of which appears on your PDA.
  Whether your arrival was due to a space accident forcing an emergency landing, or a deliberate mission sent by Nanotrasen or another corporation to colonize this world,
  is up to you to decide.

  There is currently no strict lore explaining how the crew ended up there, but the goal is clear: survive, and try to make this place habitable for yourself and others.
  You are free to set up your own backstory for each shift so long as you communicate/coordinate it with others.

  [bold]Natives are an exception[/bold]: players choosing the Native role are expected to play as characters who have been living on this planet for a while.
  Perhaps they are members of a native tribe, or another group of colonists who have been sent there earlier - the specifics are up to the players to decide.
