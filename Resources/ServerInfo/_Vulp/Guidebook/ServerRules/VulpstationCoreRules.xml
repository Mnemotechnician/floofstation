[color=#99ff99]Vulpstation is an English-speaking adult-only medium roleplay server. ERP (erotic roleplay) is allowed, but is NOT the focus of the server.[/color]

[color=#a4885c][head=3]Admins may, within reason, act outside of the rules listed below. Admins will be held accountable through use of the admin code of conduct. This mandate, informally known as "Rule 0", is to be used sparingly, for serious situations that otherwise cannot be easily resolved.[/head][/color]

[color=#ffff00]If you have any questions about these rules, please use the Admin Help menu (AHelp) by pressing the F1 key, or clicking the "AHelp" button on top of your screen (the one with a danger symbol on it).[/color]

[color=#ffff00]If you are ever unsure of something, or got a particular idea, ask an Admin via AHelp. No response does not equate to permission.[/color]
