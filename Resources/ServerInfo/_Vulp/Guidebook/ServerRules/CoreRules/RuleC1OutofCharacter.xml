  [color=#a4885c]1.1[/color] Be polite, civil and respectful towards other players and admins. Respect their roleplay preferences and boundaries. If somebody ever asks you to stop bothering them LOOC (local-out-of-character), do so.

  [color=#a4885c]1.2[/color] Hate speech is forbidden. This applies primarily to OOC, but its usage IC without a valid reason (i.e. playing a bigoted character) may also be punished . Usage of terms and behavior out of sheer hate or bigotry, will be punished.

  [color=#a4885c]1.4[/color] Do not disconnect during an AHelp in progress.

  [color=#a4885c]1.5[/color] Rule lawyering and rule skirting is not tolerated.

  [color=#a4885c]1.6[/color] Usage of third party cheat software and exploits is forbidden.

  [color=#a4885c]1.7[/color] Intentionally trying to damage the server (e.g. chat flooding, using glitches to lag the server) is forbidden.
