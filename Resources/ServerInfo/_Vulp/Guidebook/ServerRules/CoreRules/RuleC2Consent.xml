  [color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 2: Consent[/head][/color]

  [color=#a4885c]2.1[/color] Erotic roleplay requires the OOC consent of all parties involved. Non-erotic roleplay does not require it, however, you should still respect it to an extent (for example, don't play a "bad cop" unless players agree to it, or it's part of a planned event).

  [color=#a4885c]2.2[/color] Roleplay may occur under implied consent when all players involved engage in roleplay that suggests mutual willingness with no OOC objections raised during or immediately after the interaction. However, if at any point one of the players expresses discomfort or objects OOC, the roleplay should stop. The same applies to ERP as well.

  [color=#a4885c]2.3[/color] In-character consent is not required for any form of in-game interactions, so long as OOC consent is obtained and other server rules are followed.

  [color=#a4885c]2.4[/color] The consent preferences form can be used as a way of giving and obtaining OOC consent implicitly. However, it is the consent form's owner responsibility to keep any information they put there up-to-date.
