  [color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 10: Command and Security[/head][/color]

  [color=#a4885c]10.1[/color] Security and Command roles are expected to know how to perform their job to the best of their ability, and are held to a higher standard of roleplay.

  [color=#a4885c]10.2[/color] Do not take on command or security jobs you are not qualified for. The only exception for this is the security cadet role.

  [color=#a4885c]10.3[/color] Do not abuse your position of power (unless this is being done privately and with consent of all parties involved).

  [color=#a4885c]10.4[/color] As a Command member, you are to adhere to your responsibilities and duties. Prioritize the needs and wants of the station, not only those of your own or of your friends. This especially applies during emergencies and crisis situations.

  [color=#a4885c]10.5[/color] As a Command member, do not put yourself unnecessarily in obviously dangerous situations that go beyond your normal duties and responsibilities, unless in emergency or during major events. For example, the Captain shouldn't go out of their way to pursue criminals.

  [color=#a4885c]10.7[/color] If you are playing a Command role, avoid disconnecting for a long time or cryoing without alerting the rest of command or assigning someone to do your job in your absence.

  [color=#a4885c]10.8[/color] Do not hire your own personal bodyguard. If you want or need one, make a formal request to the HoS for an officer to act as one. Keeping an in-character partner or pet close to you is fine, so long as they aren't being armed or ready to protect you.
