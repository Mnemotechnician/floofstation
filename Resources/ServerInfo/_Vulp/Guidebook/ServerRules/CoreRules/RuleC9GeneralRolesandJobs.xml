  [color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 9: General Roles and Jobs[/head][/color]

  [color=#a4885c]9.1[/color] If you choose a job on shift, you are required to participate in the round as said job when necessary. Do not ignore calls or emergencies. ERP does not take priority over your job. This is especially important for Command and Security jobs.

  [color=#a4885c]9.2[/color] If you are banned from a role or a department, you may not play that role or job. This includes seeking or accepting promotions into roles you are banned from.

  [color=#a4885c]9.3[/color] Try not to engage in tasks that do not fall under the purview of your job. Taking on a wider range of jobs is accepted if there are no people to perform them.

  [color=#a4885c]9.4[/color] Roles such as prisoner and gladiator are NOT intrinsically antagonistic to the crew. They can attempt to break out or hide when given opportunity (e.g. due to an explosion breaking the brig open) or mistreated by security, but not attempt to break out at round start.

  [color=#a4885c]9.5[/color] Ghost roles have their own independent rules that must be followed.
